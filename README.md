# Asynchronous-UART-FIFO-System
An RTL implementation of an Asynchronous UART–FIFO Loopback System in Verilog, operating at 9600 bps. The design integrates a baud generator, UART transmitter and receiver with 16× oversampling, and dual-clock FIFOs for safe clock-domain crossing. A loopback path validates end-to-end data transfer.
